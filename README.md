Simple isomorphic wrapper for Lazy.js - Like underscore, but with lazy evaluation that allows for cases with much faster performance; and other cool sequence/ node stream functionality - see [lazy.js](http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/)

# Future Plans

Replace performance critcal usages of _ with Lazy()
